TO USE LENNY:

Step 1: Connecting
Right now he's set up to auto-connect to my phone's hotspot. That way I can look on my 
phone to see what the IP address is, and ssh in from my laptop also connected to my 
hotspot. It's supposed to have a static IP, but it doesn't seem to work yet.

Step 2: Running
In the home folder there's a symlink to the relavant code called 'LennysCode'. cd into
that folder, and you can either run main.py to run the main code, or open a python shell
and import files directly and mess with the functions there (good for debugging).

Commands:

cd ECEN-361-Project/ECEN-361-Project/From\ Lenny/LennysCode/
python main.py

and there you go!!
