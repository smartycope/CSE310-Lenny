# Lenny
Lenny is a self-balancing robot.

He will run on a Raspberry Pi runningl a Python script that utilizes reinforcement learning to learn how to balance. We will not program him how to balance directly.

This is to gain experience with neural networks, and how they interact with hardware.

<!-- Include a video walkthrough of the code and Lenny running here eventually -->

# Development Enviroment
For this project, we will be using:
- Tensorflow
    - For the neural network
- gymnasium (formerly gym)
    - For the RL environment
- pygame
    - For the simulation, for debugging the NN
- Python
    - For main implementation
- Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) - Headless
    - To run on the Raspberry Pi
- wpa_supplicant
    - To connect to Wifi via command line
- VSCodium
    - IDE
- SSH
    - To upload & edit files on the Raspberry Pi
